# F1 Steward Bot
Code for my F1 Discord bot, F1 Steward Bot. 

If you would like to invite this bot to your discord server, DM me, KimJammer#4819.


If you want to run this yourself, do this:
1. Clone/Download this repo
2. Create a config.json file in the src folder and format it like this:

{
  "token": "DiscordBotToken",
  "guildId": "TestServerId",
  "clientId": "DiscordBotClientId"
}

3. You have two option to run: go to src and run "npm install" and then"node main.js" or go to src and run "docker-compose up".
